		My name is Nicholas Chedid. I was born in Brasil and in '09 I moved to Portugal with my family. I'm a student at Porto University, studing <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/pt/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=870" target="_blank">Network and Information Systems Engineering</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		From an early age I was always an tech enthusiast although I never followed this path when growing up. My first time trying to "work" with programming was when me and my friends were trying to get our own private server of a game called tibia. After that I'd be glued to the computer whenever during the holidays my uncle had to work on my computer doing BANAL things like watching if the testing he had to check was running smoothly.

		When it was time to choose what I wanted to follow at University Computer Science (or one of the many paths) was always my first pick but my grades didn't allowed me to, so I went to 2 years of Environmental Engieneering. I was fine doing that but I was not happy and didn't see myself doing that for the rest of my life until one day...

		This day was when I found out about tuts+ and their free 30 days to learn HTML/CSS. After printing the famous "hello world!" on a webpage I knew that that was my goal in life.
