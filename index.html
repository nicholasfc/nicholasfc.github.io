	<h1>Welcome.</h1>

	<p>Hi! My name is Nicholas Chedid and I'm a <a href="https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/pt/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=870" target="_blank">Network and Information Systems Engineering</a> student at Porto University, Portugal. You can learn more about me and find my Resume on this <a href="/about">page</a>.</p>

	<p>I really like exploring the world of web development (focus on front-end) and Network &amp; Security. Right now I'm looking for a summer internship (mid july ~ mid september) on those topics. If you have a position let me know at <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}"> {{ site.email }}</a></p>

	<p>So far I don't have any project worth showcasing but you can read what I've been up to at my <a href="/blog">blog</a>. And all my code can be found at my <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>

	<p>Feel free to look around.</p>
